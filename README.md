Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
Its importance in the technology industry are it plays a crucial role by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The milestones include the development of programming languages (e.g Fortran etc), establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s and the advent of structured programming in the 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The phases of software development life cycle are; requirements,design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance.
1.Requirements: Gathering and documenting users needs and system requirements.
2.Design: Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3.implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4.Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5.Deployment: Releasing the software to users to customers.
6.Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the  software after deployment.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodologies are sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g requirements, designs, implementation) while agile methodologies are iterative and incremental approach (e.g testing, deployment and maintenance)

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer: Responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
A quality assurance engineer: ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
A project manager:oversees the planning, execution and delivering of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments(IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code (e.g visual studio,Eclipse etc)
Version control systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g Git, subversion)
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
The common challenges faced by software engineers are changing requirements,tight deadlines and technical debt)
The strategies for overcoming these challenges include effective communication,agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular assessment of project goals and timelines.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: involves testing individual components or modules of software
Integration testing:involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System testing: involves testing the entire software as a whole.
Acceptance testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user neeeds.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models thereby thinking of it as giving clear and specific instructions to a very smart assistant to get exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example is If you ask,"Tell me about dogs,the AI might give a general answer and to make it clear, specific and concise is "Tell me the history of domestic dogs"
